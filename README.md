# Web_Design-High_School_2012-2013

In high school, I took a web design class. While everyone else just used the WYSIWYG method, I looked at and learned the code of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. If you want to view the website as a working website, download the folder and click on the index.html file.

NOTE: I am aware I could have uploaded my files, making them a functioning website, like everyone else. But why not do it this way? Why pay for the domain name and hosting for websites I was instructed to make in high school that are now part of my portfolio? Using GitHub to allow people to view the files makes more sense to me.
